# dom
stuff I worked on including python scripts and perl

## Scripts

- 1 - [bdu](https://github.com/hj1996/dom/blob/master/bdu.py) - This script connects to server over SSH to run commands to get port spanning information the input is a text file called switch_list.txt that contain the ip address of the switches seperated with a new line
- 2 - [enable pass change](https://github.com/hj1996/dom/blob/master/enable%20pass%20change.py) - This script connects to router and switches and changes the enable password.
